<p>Everyone is well aware of how to make a decision. From a very early age, we are taught how to decide. The question is not on how to make a decision, but how to make the correct decision. During our life's path, there are no correct decisions only decisions that are more right than others. So, as long as you are going about analyzing (or over analyzing) decisions in your life, you should at least go about it in a systematic way. A good business is just a series of repeatable steps that leads to a successful outcome. The same should apply to decision making.</p><p><b>1) </b><b>Analyze and Document ALL options</b></p><p>You can go into great detail into listing ALL options, but let's be reasonable. Also, make sure you keep the decision linear. Think in straight lines and don't think too far out of the box. This helps to eliminate emotion from our decision and come to a logical conclusion.</p><p><b>2) Extrapolate ALL options</b></p><p>Once you have listed all of your options, now take those on their respective linear paths. This will help you to formulate the visualization that will come later. For example, if I decide to live in the city, it may mean I give up my car and see my parents less. Or if I decide to live in the Suburbs I keep my car, see my parents more but also don't get to eat and drink at the best restaurants as frequently as I had hoped.</p><p><b>3) Eliminate Outliers</b></p><p>This may not seem to be an important step, but it most certainly is. It is important in the fact, that it helps your mind grasp the concept of what is guiding you. Where we eliminated emotions earlier, we need to bring them back into our psyche to help us feel comfortable with our final decision.</p><p><b>4) Visualize</b></p><p>Most people here would build some sort of pro/con list, but, in my experiences, these types of list only help to reinforce the decision we have already made. Instead of the list, visualize your life with the various decision you have made. Walk through each decision and the steps you have extrapolated out. What would Wednesday morning feel like if I made this decision. What would Saturday afternoon feel like. What would I tell my wife, son, husband, mom, etc. on a Thursday about my life. Walk through the various aspects of the decision tree in your mind and really picture your life with each decision.</p><p><b>5) DECIDE!</b></p><p>Derek Sivers like to say, "Hell Yeah or No!" He describes this as "...when deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than, "Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Helly yea! - then my answer is no."</p><p>Now, when he says, "No" this doesn't mean go back to not making a decision. Because we began this exercise knowing we had to make a decision. So, do not delay the inevitable so a decision will have to be made for you. You have already formulated all the possible options and extrapolated all scenarios, both on paper and in your mind. Now, go out and act like a kindergartner and DECIDE!</p><p>.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">maccman</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>

Walk through the various aspects of the decision tree in your mind and really picture your life with each decision."},{"id":"8c02eb33-fd40-49c9-8948-8e48d113b8c2","item":"63ef7abe-b321-427e-8afa-8c8c62c22ac9","type":"text","html":"<p><b>5) DECIDE!</b></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"5) DECIDE!"},{"id":"8d8fa3fd-4727-4d81-9bf1-c17c37c229fe","item":"63ef7abe-b321-427e-8afa-8c8c62c22ac9","type":"text","html":"<p>Derek Sivers like to say, \"Hell Yeah or No!\" He describes this as \"...when deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than, \"Wow!
